This repository contains the supplementary audio files of the simulation study for the paper "BLIND SEPARATION OF MULTIPLE SPEAKERS IN NOISY REVERBERANT
ENVIRONMENTS USING RELATIVE TRANSFER MATRIX OF MULTIPLE MICROPHONES" submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025).

Experimental recordings from a real room are uploaded to Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13266560).
